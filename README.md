# Employee Polls Web App Project

The Employee Polls application is designed to improve collaboration and transparency within the company. This internal tool allows every employee to create and vote on polls with two proposed solutions.
Features:
- Create Polls: Employees can create polls by asking a question in the form: "Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?". Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.
- Vote on Polls: Employees can vote on their preferred solution for each poll.
- View Polls: Employees can see which polls they haven't answered and view the results of polls to see how others have voted.
- Leaderboard: A dashboard lists every employee, ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered, incentivizing participation.
